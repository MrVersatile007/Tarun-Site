										<p>Driven by Data: Passionate Data Scientist | Machine Learning Enthusiast <a href=""></a></p>
									</header>

									<h3>My Story</h3>

									<p>
										I am a Data Scientist with a solid foundation in Electrical and Electronics Engineering and Computer Science, who has evolved into a machine learning researcher and data-driven problem solver. My journey began with a Bachelor's degree in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from Guru Nanak Institute of Technology in Hyderabad, India, where I graduated with honors in 2021. During this time, I presented a seminar on Autonomous Driving Vehicles (SAE Level 3) at the IEEE 2019 Pre-Conference and led a project on implementing IoT with RFID technology.
									</p>
									
									<p>
										Driven by a passion for data, I pursued a certification course in Data Science in 2022 to further my coding and mathematics skills, facilitating my transition into the data science field. I worked as a Data Analyst at Brewcode Tech, where I used SQL, Python (with Pandas and Matplotlib), and Tableau to enhance data analysis workflows, develop interactive dashboards, and support data-driven decisions that resulted in a 20% improvement in key business metrics.

									</p>
									
									<p>
										To deepen my expertise, I pursued a Master's degree in Computer Science, specializing in Machine Learning, at Rowan University in the United States. In recognition of my academic achievements and contributions to the research community, I was honored with the Rowan University Outstanding Graduate Award for 2024 and the Rowan University Research Ambassador award. As a Research Ambassador, I represented the university's research initiatives and contributed to fostering a collaborative academic environment.
									</p>
									
									<p>
										My thesis, titled "New Approaches for Dynamic Graph Anomaly Detection, Prediction, and Explanation," tackles the complex challenges of detecting and explaining anomalies in evolving graphs. This research, funded by NSF Award #2213658, utilizes advanced machine learning techniques to advance the field of dynamic graph analysis.
									</p>
									
									<p>
										Recognizing the importance of a formal education in computer science, I made the pivotal decision to enroll in a Master's program in Computer Science with a specialization in Data Science/ML at Rowan University in the United States. My anticipated graduation date is in 2024.
									</p>
									
									<p>
										Throughout my graduate studies, I have strategically selected courses that encompass a diverse range of disciplines. My coursework includes Advanced Web Development, Computer Networks, Database Management Systems, and Cybersecurity. For my thesis, I am delving into Machine Learning and Data Mining, combining theoretical knowledge with practical application.
									</p>
									
									<p>
										I have also had the privilege of contributing to the education of undergraduates as a Graduate Teaching Fellow, teaching fundamental concepts in Cybersecurity.
									</p>
									
									<p>
										Furthermore, I have had the opportunity to engage in impactful research projects alongside my Graduate Thesis Advisor, Dr. Ho. These projects involve proposals submitted to prestigious organizations such as the NSF, ACM, and IEEE, adding depth and breadth to my academic pursuits.

												<h4>Change Point Detection in Evolving Graph using Martingale</h4>
												<blockquote>
													ABSTRACT : Many real world applications are modeled as groups of interacting entities using dynamic graphs due to the nature of the application domains such as sensor network, social network, computer network, urban traffic network, and power grid. A change in the evolving graph or a change in the behavior of the interacting entities can be viewed as a change in the graph distribution or graph generating process.
We describe our proposed change-point detection approach for an evolving graph by monitoring the martingale values derived from the extracted graph features. We demonstrate empirically that the feature representation that encodes a graph property (or char- acteristics) is critical in the performance of the martingale test in detecting the change-point using two synthetic (random topology, scale-free) graph generators and a real-world dataset. On the other hand, we demonstrate that the theoretical false positive bound for a martingale change-detection is preserved even when different fea- ture representations are used. We further discuss the use of multiple martingale tests on different graph features allowing one to iden- tify which graph property changes and provide explanations to the change-point detected.
