										As part of my academic journey, I had the privilege of presenting my seminar on Autonomous Driving Vehicles (SAE Level 3) at the IEEE 2019 Pre-Conference. Additionally, I undertook a significant project focusing on IoT implementation using RFID Technology.
									</p>
									
									<p>
										Motivated by a strong interest in data-related fields, such as Data Science, Machine Learning, Data Analysis, Data Engineering, Data Management, Artificial Intelligence, and Machine Learning, I embarked on a journey to acquire specialized skills. To facilitate this transition, I pursued a certification course in Data Science from January 2022 to May 2022. This experience allowed me to strengthen my coding and mathematics proficiency.
									</p>
									
									<p>
										In June 2022, I served as a Python Automation Intern at Harman International, where I gained valuable hands-on experience in the field.
									</p>
									
									<p>
										Recognizing the importance of a formal education in computer science, I made the pivotal decision to enroll in a Master's program in Computer Science with a specialization in Data Science/ML at Rowan University in the United States. My anticipated graduation date is in 2024.
									</p>
									
									<p>
										Throughout my graduate studies, I have strategically selected courses that encompass a diverse range of disciplines. My coursework includes Advanced Web Development, Computer Networks, Database Management Systems, and Cybersecurity. For my thesis, I am delving into Machine Learning and Data Mining, combining theoretical knowledge with practical application.
									</p>
									
									<p>
										I have also had the privilege of contributing to the education of undergraduates as a Graduate Teaching Fellow, teaching fundamental concepts in Cybersecurity.
									</p>
									
									<p>
										Furthermore, I have had the opportunity to engage in impactful research projects alongside my Graduate Thesis Advisor, Dr. Ho. These projects involve proposals submitted to prestigious organizations such as the NSF, ACM, and IEEE, adding depth and breadth to my academic pursuits.
